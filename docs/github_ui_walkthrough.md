1. Check the Issues and Pull Requests to see if the [song](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojibops/labels/add%20songs) is listed. If it is not listed as an issue or Pull Request, continue to the next step. If there is an Issue of Pull Request, choose something else to add. 
2. Fork this repository. This will create a copy of the repository and create a new repository on your account. Note: the `Fork` button is located in the top right area of the repo.
3. Once the repo is forked, you will be taken to the forked repo. Note: In the top left, the name of the repo should now include your username.
4. Navigate to the `data.js` file in your forked repo by clicking on the file name.
5. Edit the `data.js` file by clicking on the pencil icon and add a new object for your song in alphabetical order.  **Note: If the song title starts with 'The' then use the next word for alphabetical order.** Make sure there is a comma between your object and the object above and below. Refer to the card overview above for requirements for the different object keys.

```

}
```
